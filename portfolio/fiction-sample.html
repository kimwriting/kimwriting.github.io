It wasn't a smart goat, as has been said, but this day was particularly a struggle for the goat, as the pasture it wandered into was actually a missile silo hidden in plain sight by the American military.</p> <p>Suffice it to say that collars were snagged when the missile went up, and the adventures that the feeble-minded old goat had on that occasion were fantastic, fantastical, and the subject of many a future story, but not this one. This is about the day the missiles went up and refused to explode. War that was rejected by the very tools to make said war.</p></div></div></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
